## Getting Started

See the [Getting Started](/helius/getting-started) page for more details.

## Examples

- [Get all assets by group](/helius/examples/get-all-assets-by-group) (collection snapshot)
- [Get all assets by owner](/helius/examples/get-all-assets-by-owner) (token-gating)
- [Solana connection](/helius/examples/solana-connection) (Use the Solana connection)

## Scripts

There are scripts in `snippets/helius` that you can run like so:

```sh
# Get all assets by group (eg, collection)
# This logic is useful if you want to get a snapshot of all assets in a group and their owners.
# Supported env vars: GROUP to look up and OWNERS to filter on.
HELIUS_API_KEY='<your-api-key>' HELIUS_CLUSTER=mainnet-beta pnpm esrun snippets/helius/example-get-all-assets-by-group.ts

# Get all assets by owner
# This logic is useful if you want to 'token-gate' a user's access to your app.
# Supported env vars: OWNER to look up and GROUPS to filter on.
HELIUS_API_KEY='<your-api-key>' HELIUS_CLUSTER=mainnet-beta pnpm esrun snippets/helius/example-get-all-assets-by-owner.ts

# Show how to use the Solana connection exposed by the Helius SDK.
HELIUS_API_KEY='<your-api-key>' HELIUS_CLUSTER=mainnet-beta pnpm esrun snippets/helius/example-solana-ts-connection.ts
```
